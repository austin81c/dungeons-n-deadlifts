# Dungeons & Deadlifts
#### The Fantastic Way to Train!

### Overview
Dungeons & Deadlifts (DxD) is a fitness tracker app that employs familiar tabletop RPG mechanics to encourage healthy excercise habits. Each user will create a representation of themselves within the app using the familiar D&D character creation process. When a user excercises in the real world, their character gains experience points in the most relevant D&D attribute slot. A wide array of physical activity is tracked by DxD including sports, running, weightlifting, and yoga. The more you excercise, the more features become available!

### Components
DxD uses Python to handle the application logic and game rules. A CLI will be available initially, with a responsive web app coming soon. 

### Planned Features
* Character Creation with 3 input options
  + Python CLI
